## Working of NewsHack
The working of web crawler recursively keeps on adds newer URLs to the database repository of the search engine. The following steps are involved in working of a web crawler:
 Initializing the seed URL or URLs
 Adding it to the frontier
 Selecting the URL from the frontier
 Fetching the web-page corresponding to that URLs
 Parsing the retrieved page to extract the URLs
 Adding all the unvisited links to the list of URL i.e. into the frontier

The major function of a web crawler is to add new links into the frontier and to choose a recent URL from it for further processing after every last step.
